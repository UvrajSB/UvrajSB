Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I enjoy working on privacy-centric AI approaches these days. My focus and experience lean more toward the **SysML** side of such architectures, while I’m also developing my expertise in core model optimization techniques. 🤖

Apart from that, I’ve really enjoyed working on native **Android app development** 📱 and building backend systems in **Golang** for low-latency, high-throughput systems. 🚀

Oh, and here's a bit of a tangent but an exciting one—I’ve also worked with **Software Defined Radios**, low-powered sensing systems, and ubiquitous technologies. 📡🔋
